- templating is when you can reuse the same html file (structure of a page) for a bunch of pages
- you can sub in variables 
- you can manipulate variables in one shot way in templates = filtering 
    example: template_title | title 
    this makes the template_title capitalize the first letter of the word
     <p> A {{ template_description | default(template_recipe) }} recipe</p>
      once its inside the {{ }} then any other template variable is fair game!! like above

- inheretance: the file that all the other files inherit from has the content that is inhereited. 
the content based is put inside {% block content %}
{% endblock %}
