database schema: the way a database is organized in entities, attributes and relationships, without data being present

Entities: objects (tables)
Attributes (noun): properties of entities (columns of tables); contrained to a type (ex. string or num or cannot be non)
Relationships (verb): represented as arrows when things are related


primary key column: uniquely identify entries in the table (all the indivuals of the people table)
foreign key column: represent references to the primary keys of other tables



models = classes that mirror the database tables 
entity/table = class
attributes = instance attributes
indivual entries in table (rows) = instances of class (object)

ex. book class has attribute and instance attribute of ID
now you can make many book objects and all these objects are simply rows in a table

the attributes are declared LIKE class variables but its not!! sqlAlchemy used metaclass to design a class to accept that!
